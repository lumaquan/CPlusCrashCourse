A CLASS is an specification of data members and memeber functions.
An OBJECT "comes" from a class

CORRECTNESS: the right output to all expected inputs in a program
ROBUSTNESS: handle unexpected inputs 
ADAPTABILITY: software must be able to evolve over time
REUSABILITY: software must be able to be reused in different systems/subsystems

ADT: is mathematical model of a data structure that specifies the type of data stored, 
     operations suppoted, and the type of parameters of these operations. Expresses
     the WHAT can be donde and not the HOW it's done.

CLASS is the realization of an ADT. It also specifies HOW the operations are performed, 
       though the public interface should not provide any hint about it.

ENCAPSULATION: components should not reveal HOW they implement their inner workings. The 
    contract is to maintain the public interface.

MODULARITY: different parts of a system are organized as a functional units.

INHERITANCE: design of general classes that can be specialized to particular classes.
