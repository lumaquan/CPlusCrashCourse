3.2.1 Concrete Types -----------------

"just like built-in types"

For a CONCRETE TYPE it representation is part of its definition.

An ABSTRACT TYPE isolates the user from implementation details.

VIRTUAL means maybe redefined later in a class derived.

POLYMORPHIC TYPE: provides the interface for a variety of other classes.
