20.1 Introduction ------------------

Derived classes and their mechanism help express commonaity and hierarchical
relationships.

Implementation inheritance: inherit facilities from base class to derived class.

Interface inheritance: use several different derived classes interchangeably thru 
the common interface of base class.

Interface inheritane = dynamic polymorphism or runtime polymorphism.
Templates = static polymorphims

20.2 Derived Classes ----------------

BaseClass* pb = new BaseClass
 (DerivedClass * )pb   is a valid pointer to object of derive, but the methods
        and available in derived class will used data members not initialized.
